# PathfindingMazeSolver
For solving a maze, it required some searching technique. Here to solve the maze in a shortest possible way I used searching technique DFS (Depth First Search).  
Maze also surrounded by walls and it have a starting node and goal node i.e. to get out of the node. It used algorithm called “Wall Following algorithm”. 
To construct the maze, I used some rows and columns that represent the wall. Basically, it used following technique to solve the maze.

•	Wall Following Algorithm
•	Depth First Search
•	For constructing the maze, it used rows and columns
•	It solved the maze in shortest possible way.
•	It has two nodes i.e. starting and goal node.
•	It used some technique called “Decision Making Technique”.

A maze may be a network of paths, typically from an entrance to exit. 
The concept of Maze approximately thousand years old. Which was invented in Egypt.
From then, many mathematicians made various algorithm to unravel the maze.
Now a days, maze solving problem is a crucial field. 
It is based on one of the most important Algorithm, which is “Decision Making Algorithm”. Cause, the starting path is going to be placed in unknown place, 
and it requires to possess an honest decision-making capability. There are many sorts of maze solving using various sort of algorithms.

In this project, the system design of Maze solving consist obstacle avoidance ultrasonic sensors then sensors will detect the wall.
To solve the maze, this will apply wall following algorithms like left- or right-hand rule. It will also follow the Flood fill algorithm for locating the shortest path.
